“We know bullying is a challenge many face, particularly young people. We are committed to leading the industry in the fight against online bullying, and we are rethinking the whole experience of Instagram to meet that commitment. We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves. Today we’re announcing one new feature in both areas.
💙
Encouraging Positive Interactions
In the last few days, we started rolling out a new feature powered by AI that notifies people when their comment may be considered offensive before it’s posted. This intervention gives people a chance to reflect and undo their comment and prevents the recipient from receiving the harmful comment notification.
🧡
Protecting Your Account From Unwanted Interactions With Restrict
We wanted to create a feature that allows people to control their Instagram experience, without notifying someone who may be targeting them. Soon, we will begin testing a new way to protect your account from unwanted interactions called Restrict.
💛
It’s our responsibility to create a safe environment on Instagram. This has been an important priority for us for some time, and we are continuing to invest in better understanding and tackling this problem.”

But who needs to hide when you have a best friend like Ice? Today on our story and on IGTV, MacGyver (@macgyverlizard) and his human Ice share a picnic in the park and curl up at home for some well-deserved 💤. Every Saturday, we’re diving down the 🐇🕳 to uncover unique and treasured accounts — the real #HiddenGems of Instagram. ✨💎"}}]}}},{"node":{"id":"2082885972701222398","shortcode":"Bzn5cGugBX-","display_url":"https:\u002F\u002Fscontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com\u002Fvp\u002Fff9b0d95215b33df45ea153f95239da4\u002F5DC3B00B\u002Ft51.2885-15\u002Fe35\u002F62161268_101722731108092_86447030882729733_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com","edge_media_to_caption":{"edges":[{"node":{"text":"#HelloFrom South Tyrol, Italy — the home of these natural sand towers that offer a glimpse into another world. 👽 “I was fascinated by them since the first time I heard about them as a child during a holiday in South Tyrol,” says landscape photographer and geographer Kilian Schönberger (@kilianschoenberger). “The scene is fantabulous and geo-scientifically interesting at the same time.” Say #HelloFrom your part of the world. ❤️ Please submit your own photos and videos to the project using the #HelloFrom hashtag.

We are committed to leading the industry in the fight against online bullying, and we are rethinking the whole experience of Instagram to meet that commitment. We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves. Today we’re announcing one new feature in both areas.\n💙\nEncouraging Positive Interactions\nIn the last few days, we started rolling out a new feature powered by AI that notifies people when their comment may be considered offensive before it’s posted. This intervention gives people a chance to reflect and undo their comment and prevents the recipient from receiving the harmful comment notification.\n🧡\nProtecting Your Account From Unwanted Interactions With Restrict\nWe wanted to create a feature that allows people to control their Instagram experience, without notifying someone who may be targeting them. Soon, we will begin testing a new way to protect your account from unwanted interactions called Restrict.\n💛\nIt’s our responsibility to create a safe environment on Instagram. This has been an important priority for us for some time, and we are continuing to invest in better understanding and tackling this problem.”\n💗\nTo learn more about these new updates, click the link in our bio.

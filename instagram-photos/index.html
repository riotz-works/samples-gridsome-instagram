“The thing that struck me the most is how each one of our decisions, no matter where we live in this world, affects every other human being and every other creature on this planet.

We can all find a little more space for kindness and generosity with one another, because the minute we hold space for that, the minute we are able to care more about things like our oceans and seas.”⁣

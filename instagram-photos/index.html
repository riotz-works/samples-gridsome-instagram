So personally, my favorite part of being a woman, is my mouth. I just love what comes out each time I speak. That is how we lead, through speaking up.” ⁣

New Delhi-based photojournalist Ashish Sharma (@ashishsharmaphotos) describes Holi as joyous and cheerful, “where people are united to celebrate the colors of life.”⁣⁣⁣
⁣
The centuries-old festival celebrated in India and in other Hindu communities around the world brings people together to welcome springtime with music, laughter, dancing and colored powder — lots and lots of colored powder.⁣⁣
⁣
The green represents new beginnings, yellow signifies turmeric, blue is for Krishna and red is for love.⁣⁣⁣

Today we’re sharing some vibrant moments from the festival and the weeklong celebrations leading up to it, viewed through Ashish’s lens.⁣⁣⁣

“Women are so powerful, and what’s so wonderful is that we’re discovering how much power there is more and more every single day. How it’s been locked away by misogyny and patriarchy and as generations move on, we’re totally coming together to unlock that one by one. It’s so, so, so neat. I love being a woman.” 💛⁣

“You’re grounded, but at the same time quite powerful,” she says. “Because I’m told that I’m not good enough in so many ways, the power that I feel is even stronger, because I’m trying to let that light shine even brighter.” ✨⁣

A few years ago, Enam decided to get rid of the mirrors in her home to redefine where her self-confidence comes from. “I don’t have to necessarily look in a mirror to gain confidence. I just trust that what I’m wearing and what I look like is good enough. So when I step outside, my main focus is that I’ve already come to an understanding of who I am and what I want for myself.” 💛⁣
